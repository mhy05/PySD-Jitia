*Simulating System Dynamics Models in Python*

This project is a simple library for running System Dynamics models in python, with the purpose of
improving integration of Big Data and Machine Learning into the SD workflow.

PySD translates :doc:`Vensim <development/vensim_translation>` or
:doc:`XMILE <development/xmile_translation>` model files into python modules,
and provides methods to modify, simulate, and observe those translated models.

PySD Cookbook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A cookbook of simple recipes for advanced data analytics using PySD is available at:
http://pysd-cookbook.readthedocs.org/

The cookbook includes models, sample data, and code in the form of ipython notebooks that demonstrate a variety of data integration and analysis tasks. These models can be executed on your local machine, and modified to suit your particular analysis requirements.
